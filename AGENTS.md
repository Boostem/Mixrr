# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Root contains the main script `reco.py` plus sample API payload `response_example.json`.
- Python virtual environment lives in `.venv/` (if present); keep it out of commits.
- Environment variables go in `.env` (see `.env-example` for required Spotify creds).
- Text playlists generated by `reco.py` are written to the repo root with timestamped names.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Install dependencies: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt` (if no requirements file, install ad hoc: `pip install cloudscraper coolname requests`).
- Run the recommender: `python reco.py` (interactive prompt for search/selection).
- Update dependencies snapshot (if you add requirements.txt): `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: Python 3.13 (see `python --version` in repo).
- Indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose; prefer explicit names (e.g., `fetch_track_and_recommendations`).
- Favor f-strings for formatting; avoid string concatenation.
- Keep I/O paths relative to repo root; avoid hard-coded absolute paths.

## Testing Guidelines
- No formal test suite exists yet. If adding tests, place them under a new `tests/` directory using `pytest`.
- Name tests `test_<feature>.py` with functions `test_<behavior>()`.
- Use lightweight fixtures/stubs; avoid hitting external APIs in unit tests—mock network calls.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages: present-tense, descriptive (e.g., `Add paginated Spotify search`, `Fix camelot adjacency checks`).
- Keep commits focused and minimal; avoid bundling unrelated changes (e.g., do not mix formatting and feature work).
- Pull requests should include: brief summary of changes, testing performed (`python reco.py` run notes or `pytest`), and any screenshots/text-file samples if output formatting changed.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets; `.env` holds `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. Rotate if leaked.
- Network calls hit Spotify and Tunebat; avoid spamming APIs and handle failures gracefully.
- Generated playlist files may contain user queries—clean up before publishing or sharing the repo.
